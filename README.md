# Project Overview

This is a simple todo application built with a PERN stack. A user is able to create, edit, and delete todos. I built this app by following along [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8) Youtube tutorial.

## Frontend
The frontend is built on React, which helped me break down my code into reusable components. I leveraged Bootstrap 4 to help style my app.

## Backend
I built my backend using Express and Node, partly because I'm familiar with the framework, but also to get more practice using it.

## Database
I used a Postgres database to practice working with relational databases.
